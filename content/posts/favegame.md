My favourite game are blocks.

<!--more-->

My favourite game is Minecraft, with the reason being it is fun.

Okay; there's more reasons than it just being fun. Let's start listing them out.

1, It's nostalgic. I remember when I was 6, watching Minecraft youtubers with my broken chargers. I wanted Minecraft so bad, but my parents thinks their credit card information would get stolen. And I refuse to play the Bedrock version, with the only exception being the phone version cause it's cheap.

2, You can express your imagination on there. You know? Be creative? Yeah. I'm running out of ideas.

3, It's addictive. Okay, that might be overkill, but playing Bed Wars for hours on end with my friends is extremely fun, in my defense.

So, in short, Minecraft is awesome. It can be so many games in one, with it being a clean slate for any genre of game. Sandbox games are just that cool. You can do PvP, adventure, survival, building, redstone, parkour, and many more. And when you think you have nothing to do, you can play multiplayer whether it be in a server or a SMP with your close friends. SMP is Survival Multiplayer, by the way. 

Adding onto that, because I need more content for this post, Minecraft is so versatile. There's even an education mode, but like, I don't play in that mode. What do you want me to do in there? Make a balloon?

There's even texture packs and mods! You can add your own designs and objects into the game, making it even more fun. It adds a bit of spice to the basic Minecraft graphics literally everyone knows of, while keeping it's blocky shape. 

Mods are awesome because they can add so many things. The things it can add can be helpful, absolutely adorable, or a literal demon from hell. Plus, you can even make your own, expanding your skills.

The skins are also awesome! You can even make your own, challenging the limited block format of the skin template. But I just use skins that someone else made for others to use because I can't make skins sadly. But like, at least my character looks cool. That's what matters.

Minecraft can also improve your skills! Building, art, uhhh... Fighting.. aim, and many more! You could even put it on your resume. 'Lot's of experience with architecture using the game Minecraft'. See, isn't that super legit? Totally.

Minecraft can be a favourite game to so many types of players, just because of its versatility. So, you should play Minecraft too. It's like that saying, 'Old But Gold'. I'm not sure if that applies here, but I'll act like it does.

It can also be kinda grindey when trying to hone your PvP skills, since you have to play it alot to improve your aim and such, and while not playing it for large amounts of times, you can become rusty and not be as try-hardy, which could be both good or bad. Hey, if you aren't a Minecraft grinder who plays for hours on end, at least you aren't a sweat / tryhard!

God damnit all I want to be is to be a pro at Bed Wars. That's nearly impossible though, but who knows. Office mouses and old HP laptops can make you succeed in...Minecraft.. Nevermind. Maybe I shouldn't try to be a pro. Kinda useless for the future LOL.

TL;DR : Minecraft is great, and you should buy it and play with me. Please. Someone play Bed Wars with me. PLEASE. PLEASE. I beg. Or I will kidnap your dog. Twice.
