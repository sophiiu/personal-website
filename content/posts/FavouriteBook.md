My favourite book is literlly all of Susin Nielson's books.

<!--more-->

We Are All Made Of Molecules is one my favourite book because I enjoy the way Susin Nielsen, who is also one of my favourite authors in general, incoporates both humor and serious themes in her book. The way it is written, with the alternating point of views, is also unique and fun to read.

The book is so well-written, it makes me want to erase my memories and then read it again.

Her other books are also great, No Fixed Address and Optimists Die First is beautifully written as well. No Fixed Address is so interesting, and Felix's story is inspirational, and Optimists Die First is full of twists and turns and about change.

From what I've seen, the 3 books are have some connection to trust, with Ashley realizing that sometimes not everything you see is true and be more careful to trust, with Felix and how Astrid has a bad relationship with trusting others, and with Petula, learning to trust herself and others to keep herself safe.

Nielson's approach to her books, and the way her books can have so much variety and so many different people is just amazing. She could make you cry and laugh at the same time.

Back to We Are All Made Of Molecules, it's awareness it brings and the plot is just beautiful. Seeing Ashley and Stewarts interactions are just hilarious.

No Fixed Address feels so real. Felix's story makes me so invested, and although I read it in 5th grade, I have reread it atleast twice every year. 

Felix's friends, Dylan and Winnie, and his parent, Daniel and Astrid are just amazing characters, and such a strong supporting cast. Astrid has a snarky personalitly, and even though she and Felix have some arguments, you can clearly tell they have a strong bond and love eachother even though. Winnie and Dylan are such good friends to Felix, the two being practically opposites from their house, and their personality, but that makes for such a good friendship dynamic between the three of them. Daniel, although not getting as much 'screentime' ((book time? }, you can see that Daniel cares for Felix.

The way the book ended was beautiful, especially the last paragraph, "Astrid didn't have much luck with other people growing up. But I'm not my mom. And I'm choosing to belive." Even though I wish there were a sequel, I don't think it would happen. The first book ended so nicely, and the flow is great, that I just simply can't think of something that would make a good sequel plot.

Now, onto Optimists Die First. I love how the tradegy of Petula's sister puts guilt on herself, but her family also feels the guilt. Its story is beautiful, and Petula's character development with her therapy group, and herself, is just amazingly wrote. She slowly allows herself to trust, and it's beautiful.

In short, yes. I'm a Susin Nielson fangirl. What about it?
