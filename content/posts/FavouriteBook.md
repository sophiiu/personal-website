My favourite book is 'We Are All Made Of Molecules'.

<!--more-->

It is my favourite book because I enjoy the way Susin Nielsen, who is also one of my favourite authors in general, incoporates both humor and serious themes in her book. The way it is written, with the alternating point of views, is also unique and fun to read.

The book is so well-written, it makes me want to erase my memories and then read it again.

Her other books are also great, No Fixed Address and Optimists Die First is beautifully written as well. No Fixed Address is so interesting, and Optimists Die First is full of twists and turns.

In short, this is just me fangirling over Susin Nielson. I hope I can get ahold of her other books to read soon.
